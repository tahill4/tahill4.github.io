			purpose and highlights key information. 
			(2) “products.html”: Page allows users to browse products.
			(3) “contact-us.html”: Contact Us page provides visitors with contact page,
			email addresses, and phone numbers to reach out directly.
			(4) “info.html”: About Us page offers background information about the
			company, and its mission. -->
